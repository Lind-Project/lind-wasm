//! Handler table implementation.
//!
//! This module provides the global `HANDLERTABLE` implementation, which
//! used in threei.rs.
//!
//! Two alternative backends are supported:
//! - `hashmap` (default, `Mutex<HashMap<..>>`) in `hashmap_impl.rs`
//! - `dashmap` (optional, concurrent `DashMap<..>`) in `dashmap_impl.rs`
//!
//! The dual implementation exists primarily so that future benchmarking
//! and performance analysis can easily compare `hashmap` vs `dashmap`
//! under different workloads.
//!
//! See README.md in the project directory for usage details.
