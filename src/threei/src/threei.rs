/// copies memory across cages.  Interposable
///
/// This copies memory across cages.  One common use of this is to read
/// arguments which are passed by reference instead of by value.  The
/// source and destination cages may each be different from the calling
/// cage.  This may be useful for some grates.
///
/// Note that this call is itself interposable.  While threei does do some
/// checking, in theory, a grate may want to filter or disable this for
/// some descendant cages.
///
/// The maxsize and copytype arguments make the behavor act like strncpy or
/// memcpy.
///
/// ### Multithreading
/// This function performs *range and permission checks* and then copies bytes.
/// It does **not** acquire or hold any locks on the source or destination
/// mappings. In a multithreaded program, other threads (or cages) may
/// concurrently mutate or unmap these regions while the checks or the copy
/// are in progress. The behavior in that case is undefined from the caller’s
/// perspective (typical outcomes include torn reads/writes or faults).
///
/// ### Thread safety
/// This API is **not thread-safe w.r.t. the memory contents**. It is analogous
/// to calling `memcpy`/`strncpy` on raw pointers in C: the caller must ensure
/// that the specified intervals are exclusively owned or otherwise protected
/// for the entire duration of the call.
///
/// **Users need to ensure** that the specified memory regions remain valid,
/// mapped, and stable (i.e., not unmapped, re-mapped, or concurrently written)
/// for the entire duration of this operation.
///
/// ### Scope & constraints
/// - Cross-cage only: `srccage` and `destcage` must be different. Calls with
///   the same cage for source and destination are rejected with `ELINDAPIABORTED`.
/// - No shared memory is assumed between cages; overlapping regions across cages
///   are therefore impossible since wasm linear memory module.
/// - For intra-cage copies, callers should use a local memcpy/memmove path
///   instead of this 3i API.
///
/// ## Arguments:
/// - thiscage: ID of the cage initiating the call (used for address resolution).
/// - srcaddr: Virtual address in srccage where the data starts.
/// - srccage: Cage that owns the source data.
/// - destaddr: Destination virtual address in destcage; if 0, memory will be allocated
/// in this call.
/// - destcage: Cage that will receive the copied data.
/// - len: Number of bytes to copy for memcpy mode or maximum limit for strncpy.
/// - copytype: Type of copy: 0 = raw (memcpy), 1 = bounded string (strncpy).
///
/// ## Returns:
/// - `destaddr` (the destination address where data was written) on success.
/// - `ELINDAPIABORTED` on failure, due to:
///     - Invalid memory ranges or permission checks,
///     - Failed string validation (e.g., missing null terminator).
///     - Invalid copytype.
