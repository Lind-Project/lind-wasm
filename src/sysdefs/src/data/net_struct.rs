//! Network-related data structures
//!
//! This file defines minimal, libc-compatible socket data structures that RawPOSIX uses at the FFI boundary.
//! The goal is to expose a single, compact representation (`SockAddr`) that can be filled from a raw
//! `sockaddr*` and queried for its effective size without depending on higher-level network crates.
//!
//! The layout is Linux-centric and mirrors common libc ABIs: `sa_family_t` is treated as a 16-bit field
//! and the trailing payload is stored in a fixed 108-byte buffer. This buffer is reused for
//! `AF_UNIX` (`sun_path[108]`) as well as for the byte payloads of `AF_INET`/`AF_INET6`.
//!
//! Critically, we do not operate directly on the original cage pointer/buffer when parsing or normalizing
//! contents, because `AF_UNIX` often requires path conversion (e.g., adding or removing the lind_root
//! prefix). Such rewrites can change length, require shifting bytes, and must respect Linux abstract-namespace
//! vs pathname rules; doing this in the callerâ€™s cage linear memory is risky (partial writes, aliasing,
//! out-of-bounds on error, or subtle TOCTOU-style races if other code can observe the buffer). Instead
//! we first clone the relevant bytes into `SockAddr` in user-space, reason about the family and `socklen_t`,
//! and only perform any necessary in-place edits
