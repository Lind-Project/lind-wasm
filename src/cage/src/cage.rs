/// We achieve an O(1) complexity for our cage map implementation through the following three approaches:
///
/// Direct Indexing with `cageid`:
///     `cageid` directly as the index to access the `Vec`, allowing O(1) complexity for lookup, insertion,
///     and deletion.
/// `Vec<Option<Arc<Cage>>>` for Efficient Deletion:
///     When deleting an entry, we replace it with `None` instead of restructuring the `Vec`. If we were to
///     use `Vec<Arc<Cage>>`, there would be no empty slots after deletion, forcing us to use `retain()` to
///     reallocate the `Vec`, which results in O(n) complexity. Using `Vec<Option<Arc<Cage>>>` allows us to
///     maintain O(1) deletion complexity.
/// `RwLock` for Concurrent Access Control:
///     `RwLock` ensures thread-safe access to `CAGE_MAP`, providing control over concurrent reads and writes.
///     Since writes occur only during initialization (`lindrustinit`) and `fork()` / `exec()`, and deletions
///     happen only via `exit()`, the additional overhead introduced by `RwLock` should be minimal in terms
///     of overall performance impact.
///
