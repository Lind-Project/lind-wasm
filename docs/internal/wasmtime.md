# Introduction to Wasmtime

## What is Wasmtime?

Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, designed for use with WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and other WASI-inspired environments. It is part of the Bytecode Alliance, an open-source effort to create secure software foundations.

Wasmtime can run WebAssembly modules that follow the WASI standard, providing a robust and efficient environment for running WebAssembly outside of the browser.

## Getting Started with Wasmtime

To get started with Wasmtime, you can download and install it from the [official Wasmtime releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
