/*
*   The purpose of adding this test is to ensure that file descriptors (fd) 
*   are properly closed, which is useful for large software systems such 
*   as the LAMP stack that frequently open and close fds during runtime. 
*   Improper handling of fds can have implications because both RustPOSIX 
*   / RawPOSIX and Linux impose limits on the maximum number of fds that a 
*   single process can use (typically set to 1024). This test simplifies 
*   the debugging process for large software systems by providing 
*   a straightforward method to verify correct fd management.
