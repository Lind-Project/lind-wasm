# Lind

## Welcome to Lind!

Lind is a single-process sandbox that provides an option to safely execute programs. Lind executes applications using software fault isolation and a kernel microvisor to limit the potential of reaching bugs or security flaws in the application.

In Old Norse, Old High German and Old English a “lind” is a shield constructed with two layers of linden wood. Linden wood shields are lightweight, and do not split easily, an appropriate metaphor for a sandboxing system which employs two technologies.

# lind-wasm

`lind-wasm` is a WebAssembly-focused extension of the Lind project. It integrates multiple components—both in-house and third-party—to enable execution of POSIX-like applications in WebAssembly runtimes, such as Wasmtime.
